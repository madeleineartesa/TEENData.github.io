    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <h5>Privacy</h5>
    <p>According to a study by pCloud (2021), three major social media apps, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, are the top data sharers. 
        These apps share 79%, 57%, and 50% of user data to third party platforms, respectively. Facebook and Instagram collect the most 
        data for corporate benefits, namely targeted ads on and off the app. Both apps collect 86% of user data for this purpose. 
        Additionally, these two apps top the list for overall percent of data used. Although people have varying levels of privacy 
        tolerance, this does not fully align with the protection of user privacy, especially because Instagram and Facebook use data for 
        their own benefit. (Dimitrov).<br><br>
        
        In a meeting with William & Mary Assistant Professor of Data Science Dr. Alexander Nwala, he explained that there are different 
        layers to privacy. The standard idea of privacy is protecting personal information from unauthorized access. Dr. Nwala acknowledged 
        that social media companies uphold this principle, despite occasional data breaches. However, social media companies are not 
        performing well regarding corporations’ insight on user interactions. Companies collect as much as possible from users to send 
        target ads, tailor content, and inject specific content so users spend more time on the site (Nwala).
    </p>

    <h5>Accountability</h5>
    <p>Throughout the years, social media companies have been involved in many lawsuits.<br>
        
        Location Tracking Class Action: In 2022, a $37.5 million class action settlement was reached to compensate Facebook users who 
        alleged that Meta had tracked their location although they had disabled the location tracking setting. Meta was accused of using 
        internet protocol (IP) addresses to determine the location of users. The location information was then used to send strategic 
        advertisements to the user. Despite thorough evidence, Meta denied malpractice in handling user location data (Stempel). This is 
        a mark of irresponsibility and exemplifies how social media companies may not hold themselves accountable for data malpractice. 
        Organizations that collect data--a ubiquitous practice in the digital age--should not only write, update, and publicize data 
        policies, but also must adhere to those policies. <br><br>

        Twitter FTC violation: In 2022, Twitter (now X), was alleged to have collected emails and phone numbers and used the data to its 
        monetary benefit without telling users what the true purpose was. From 2013-2019, Twitter encouraged users to provide contact info 
        for the purposes of safeguarding accounts with multi-factor authentication. However, a Department of Justice Report and the Federal 
        Trade Commission (FTC) reported that Twitter purposefully used the information to send out targeted ads, which resulted in millions 
        of dollars of profits for the company. The FTC consequently issued a $150 million civil penalty (Fair). Twitter's official statement 
        on the incident reads, “We may have asked for your phone number or email address to secure or authenticate your account…[and] we 
        may have used these phone numbers or email addresses to deliver tailored advertising to you.” (X). Although they do acknowledge 
        that data was used for ads, they claim it was accidental, which is not what the Department of Justice and FTC found and charged 
        Twitter for. This is another example of a lack of accountability among social media platforms. Again, it is imperative that Twitter 
        and other social media platforms follow their own policies and intentions that they publish for users.
    </p>

    <h5>Transparency</h5>
    <p>The aforementioned lawsuits also demonstrate a lack of transparency by major social media companies, as the companies do not fully 
        reveal how they use data. The Facebook class action lawsuit demonstrated a direct contradiction to the location tracking setting 
        being disabled. In the Twitter lawsuit, users were not informed that their data would be used for a purpose other than account 
        authentication.<br><br>

        Similarly, Meta’s privacy policy only emphasizes user experience enhancement and does not disclose the financial benefits for Meta. 
        This is not explicitly stated in the Meta Privacy Policy (Meta Platforms, Inc.). However, the pCloud study reveals that 86% of user 
        data is collected for corporate benefit (Dimitrov). This discrepancy between published information from companies and third-party 
        research is an alarming indication of the inadequate transparency of social media companies.<br><br>
        
        Although companies may have detailed privacy policy statements, Dr. Nwala noted that people do not read privacy policies and that 
        companies write them with vague and complicated language to confuse users. He attributed this situation to a lack of legislature 
        regulating data collection. Nwala suggested Congress should pass laws that define explicit rights of users and use clear language 
        to eliminate loopholes (Nwala).

    <!-- Impact Subsection -->
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>Personalization might be an appealing aspect of social media, but studies show that targeted algorithms adversely and 
        disproportionately affect teenagers. Simona Mandile of The University of Bergamo studied the impact of personalized algorithms on 
        mental health, focusing on mental health before and after Instagram shifted from chronological displays to algorithmic ones. 
        Mandible found that “the introduction of the algorithm on Instagram had a negative impact on teenagers mental health, while not 
        affecting other [age] cohorts” (Mandile). This establishes a causal relationship between curated algorithms and declining mental 
        health. It also highlights the specific threat of social media on adolescents. 
    </p>

    <!-- Innovation Subsection -->
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>The European Union (EU) and California have the most up-to-date and stringent data privacy laws.<br>
        
        EU member countries and any organization collecting data on EU citizens are held accountable by the General Data Protection 
        Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect on May 25, 2018. Here is a summary of the GDPR:
        <ul><li>Necessary and defined purpose</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Individual rights: knowing how data is being used and objecting to its use</li></ul>
        <ul><li> Mandated data breach reporting within 3 days</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Very high fines for GDPR violations</li></ul><br>
        
        The US lacks strict data privacy legislature. Businesses are not required to have a legitimate reason to collect data, often 
        leading to unnecessary and not transparent data collection, as highlighted by the numerous lawsuits. Additionally, the lack of 
        large fines allows companies to get away with violations because the financial punishments they receive are miniscule compared 
        to their profits.<br><br>
        
        California has the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Here is a summary of the 
        rights that the CCPA ensures ("California Consumer"):<br>

        <ul><li>Right to know how data is collected and shared</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Right to delete collected data</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Right to opt-out of selling personal data</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Right to non-discrimination regarding the above rights</li></ul><br>

        As of 2023, two more rights joined the list through the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):
        <ul><li> Right to correct data that is incorrect</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Right to limit use of collected data</li></ul>
    </p>

    <!-- Action Steps Subsection -->
    <h3>Action Steps</h3>
    <p>By reading the Meta privacy policy, teens learn that data collected makes their experience on Meta apps more personalized. 
        However, due to correlation to mental health problems, teens should be aware of algorithmic personalization. Dr. Nwala emphasized 
        the importance of the teen controlling the algorithm, not vice versa (Nwala). Despite the potential for mental health problems, 
        if teens understand how their data is used by social media apps, they will be better equipped to recognize harmful algorithms and 
        be aware of the data they permit platforms to collect. Conscientious social media use will allow teenagers to maximize the positive 
        aspects of social media.<br><br>

        Action Steps:
        <ul><li>Reset social media algorithm, delete content and ad preferences
            <ul><li>Instagram: Navigate to "Content Preferences" in your profile menu and "Reset suggested content"</li></ul>
            <ul><li>TikTok: Reset For You feed in Settings on your profile</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Youtube: Delete account and create new one or clear watch history</li></ul>
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Set time limits. 30 minutes a day or less is recommended, but figure out a good limit for yourself based on your schedule and personal limitations.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Have deliberate purposes when using social media--gives user control over algorithm, not vice versa</li></ul>
    </p>
