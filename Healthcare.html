    <!--Integrity Subsection-->
    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <h5>Privacy</h5>
    <p>The classic example of healthcare data privacy is doctor-patient confidentiality, officially termed “medical confidentiality.” This principle ensures that 
        information shared between healthcare providers and patients is held in the strictest confidence, with few exceptions. It is upheld by various legislatures, 
        most notably the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. The HIPAA is a robust and established federal law in the US, showing a 
        national commitment to responsible data collection and use in the healthcare industry.<br><br>
        
        Here is a summary of HIPAA’s Privacy Rule (“Summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule”):<br>
        <ul><li>Covers health plans, providers, and intermediary entities that process data</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Only protects identifying information--demographics, personal details, past/present/future medical condition, past/present/futurehealth care delivery, and 
            payments. If the information is de-identified, the Privacy Rule does not apply</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Data can be used without patient authorization in these situations:
            <ul><li>Informing the patient</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Providing treatment, dealing with payment, and general management operations</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Making medical decisions in the case of an incapacitated patient</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Updating directories--name, condition, and location within hospital to help medical providers and visitors find the patient within the facility</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Notifying family members, friends, or representatives responsible for the patient’s care</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Submitting information required by law or needed for public health, judicial, law enforcement, research, or government function purposes</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Protecting the patient or others in cases of serious safety threats</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Disclosing information of deceased patients to funeral directors or coroners and for organ, eye, and tissue donations</li></ul>
        </ul></li><br>

        The Security Rule of the HIPAA is similar to the Privacy Rule, but focuses on responsible use of electronic health records. The Security Rule has multiple 
        safeguards in place to ensure sensitive electronic information is kept safe from unauthorized access. As health records are increasingly transferred to online 
        formats, the Security Rule is essential to protecting patients’ data. Here is a quick summary (“Summary of the HIPAA Security Rule”):<br>
        <ul><li>Applies to electronic personal health information (ePHI)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Requires covered entities to assess risk regularly</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Limits access to ePHI to only authorized people</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Requires authentication measures for ePHI access</li></ul>
    </p>

    <h5>Accountability</h5>
    <p>Although there have been multiple infractions on HIPAA regulations, the legal structures in place ensure that institutions are punished effectively. There are 
        two main punishments: financial and criminal. Each varies with violation severity and level of neglect (“HIPAA Violations”). Although the monetary fines are 
        not as high as those outlined in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), they are still significant and keep covered entities accountable for 
        patient data privacy.
    </p>

    <h5>Transparency</h5>
    <p>The American Medical Association the Code of Medical Ethics is not a legally binding set of regulations, but is a golden standard in the medical field. The Code 
        emphasizes informed consent, in which physicians must communicate every viable option for care to patients or their representatives. This includes diagnoses, 
        purposes for each treatment, benefits, and risks. Consent is obtained when the patient arrives at a decision and “provides specific, written consent,” which is 
        then documented in medical records (American Medical Association).<br><br>

        The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects--known as Common Rule--requires informed consent in any research setting involving humans, not just in 
        medical context. Informed consent is under the umbrella principle of respect for humans. Common Rule emphasizes that informed consent is not fulfilled with a 
        single conversation, it is an ongoing process of question-answering, meetings, and information sessions. Similar to the AMA Code, Common Rule requires 
        well-documented consent to be considered legally effective (“Informed Consent FAQs”).<br><br>
        
        Informed consent is a pillar of both medical ethics and research ethics. In both contexts, it upholds transparency and fosters trust between patients and their 
        physicians. Additionally, ongoing clear communication is essential to making beneficial and personalized decisions for the patient.

    <!--Impact Subsection-->
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>The HIPAA contains strict guidelines on handling health data, yet it is lenient toward the federal government, public health, and research activities. The 
        reason is because these activities can benefit multiple patients in the general public, including the patient whose data is used. Even for these exceptions, 
        there are precautions to ensure the data is solely being used for a legitimate and publicly beneficial manner (Office for Civil Rights (OCR)). Health data use 
        outside of the primary goal of providing appropriate care to that patient thus contributes to the public good.
    </p>

    <p>As mentioned in the previous privacy discussion, physician-patient confidentiality is a key principle in medical ethics and is upheld by federal law. That said, 
        there are a few exceptions that protect the patient and the public from harm:
        <ul><li>Intended violence to oneself or others</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Intended crime</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Child abuse</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Injuries from violence to be reported to law enforcement officials</li></ul>

        Exceptions to doctor-patient confidentiality can be subjective, usually due to vague legal wording. For example, Hawaii requires doctors to report “suspicious 
        or unusual” injuries, which is not a definite and specific term (Schleiter). Laws cannot capture every situation in which doctors and patients might find 
        themselves, which is where ethics comes in. Doctors must assess the situation and make informed decisions, balancing legal obligations and personal ethics 
        statutes.
    </p>

    <!--Innovation Subsection-->
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>The HIPAA requires annual internal audits to check that healthcare entities comply with its rules. Additionally, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) requires 
        entities to implement a corrective action plan (CAP) if a violation is identified. CAPs involve policy revision, staff retraining, and periodic status reports. 
        Furthermore, the OCR enforces CAPS within an efficient timeframe, demonstrating how the government ensures healthcare institutions are up-to-date on current 
        regulations or are effectively working on it ("HIPAA Right").
    </p>

    <!--Action Steps Subsection-->
    <h3>Action Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ul><li>Ask your healthcare providers questions and actively participate in your care. Informed consent is an ongoing conversation between you and your physician--
            uphold your part of that conversation!</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Ensure your information is correct on your personal electronic health records (PEHRs). Ask your healthcare provider for directions on how to access these 
            records if you are unsure. Usually, they are stored in a patient portal and require login and authentication.</li></ul>
