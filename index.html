    <br><h3>About TEENData</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Madeleine Chen. I am a high school student interested in data science and research ethics. 
        This website is an exploration of how data is collected by various institutions. 
        Most importantly, each section includes action steps that teens can take to navigate our data-driven world, mitigate risks, and take control of their data.</p>

    <h3>The Three I's</h3>
    <p>
        The Three I's are the ethical pillars that I chose to focus on in TEENData. There are many different aspects of data ethics, but these three words 
        consolidated many of the resources I explored before starting my research. Below are the guiding questions for each "I" pillar: <br><br>
        
        <strong>Integrity</strong>: Are companies respecting user privacy (privacy), holding themselves accountable for handling data (accountability), and informing consumers on 
        how data is being used (transparency)?<br><br>

       <strong>Impact</strong>: Do these uses of data improve the public good and inform research and policy-making on current issues?<br><br>
        
        <strong>Innovation</strong>: Are companies and countries frequently assessing their policies and implementing the most up-to-date ethical regulations?<br>
    </p>
