    <!--Integrity Subsection-->
    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <h5>Privacy</h5>
    <p>An investigation in 2019 found that some colleges use tracking software on their official websites to determine how interested applications are. This is called 
        demonstrated interest, and involves predicting likelihood of a student enrolling and succeeding at that school (Collins).<br><br>

        Another source of data for colleges is the College Board. Many students are familiar with this company, as it facilitates standardized testing, such as the SAT 
        and AP exams. Collecting this data for the College Board’s records makes sense, but it enters a gray zone when that data is sold to colleges. As anybody who 
        has interacted with the College Board's site knows, students can opt-in to having their information shared with colleges and receive communications from those 
        places. Colleges can then purchase names of students that fit the institution’s preferences for certain metrics--such as demographics, test scores, and career 
        interests. Similar to targeting advertising, colleges send personalized emails to these prospective students (Caldera).
    </p>

    <h5>Accountability</h5>
    <p>There are no specific federal regulations that protect student data from being collected by colleges and the College Board. Students may opt-in to the Student 
        Search Service after reading about its benefit to their college application process, which gives the College Board the necessary permission to share student 
        data. However, the College Board is not held accountable by legal regulations to inform students of all of its implications. Additionally, there are no 
        guidelines for how colleges should handle student data after receiving it from online tracking or the College Board’s records. 
    </p>

    <h5>Transparency</h5>
    <p>Colleges do not include data collection methods in their descriptions of the admissions process. As a result, students may be unaware that higher education 
        institutions track certain metrics in order to calculate the chance of students enrolling, staying, and graduating. Especially at schools that value 
        demonstrated interest and digital involvement, this could hurt students’ chances at admission (Collins).<br><br>

        The College Board emphasizes the benefits for students if they opt-in to the Student Search Service, but they do not disclose how higher education institutions 
        benefit from the program. This lack of transparency is concerning because it deceives students into participation. Although informed consent is a key principle 
        in the medical field, it is not a universally adopted aspect, as data use in higher education admissions shows.
    </p>

    <!--Impact Subsection-->
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>The stated purpose of the College Board’s Student Search program is to enhance college research for applicants. While that may be true, colleges also benefit 
        from this program. Information that colleges purchase from the College Board aids econometric modeling, which is used to predict enrollment rates and financial 
        aid (Moody). Ultimately, though, econometric methods are used to boost prestige and finances. Econometric modeling helps colleges admit a class that produces 
        a high enrollment yield and high retention rate, factors that increase rankings.<br><br>

        Colleges may need to prioritize applicants with the financial means to pay for expensive tuition. One reason is that high-income students provide more money to 
        the school. Another is that low-income students may drop out due to finances, thus lowering graduation rate and hurting a college’s rankings. Lower-income 
        students may be overlooked for higher-income students at colleges that depend heavily on tuition.<br><br>
        
        Another way colleges use the Student Search Service is to lower acceptance rates. Colleges can reach students that may not have planned to apply through 
        College Board’s services. Even if students are below average for that school, piquing interest in a school leads to greater perceived value and a greater 
        number of applications. By increasing the volume of applications but keeping the incoming class size the same, colleges lower their acceptance rates and boost 
        their prestige (Collins).
    </p>

    <!--Innovation Subsection-->
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>There are no current regulations or entities that oversee the way colleges collect data from students. It is difficult to gauge whether higher education 
        institutions are updating their policies on using student data in the admissions process because it is not publicized. Also, data use varies from school to 
        school depending on tuition dependency and institutional priorities.<br><br>

        Though not necessarily positive, colleges have certainly adapted to technological innovations. For example, demonstrated interest now includes online 
        interaction along with traditional campus visits and admissions office calls. This gives students more ways to engage with colleges, but it can also hurt 
        students who are unaware of all the methods of showing interest in a school.
    </p>

    <!--Action Steps Subsection-->
    <h3>Actions Steps</h3>
    <p>College admissions are a large part of some teenage students’ high school careers, and data use in this area uniquely affects adolescents. Students can use data 
        tracking to their advantage by increasing online engagement and in turn, their demonstrated interest. Note that not all colleges measure demonstrated interest, 
        so this does not apply universally.<br><br>

        Here are some tips to increasing digital interaction with colleges and universities:<br>

        <ul><li>Open emails from the college’s official email address and explore any links that interest you</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Spend time on the college’s website and explore programs that you would like to pursue</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Sign up for prospective student newsletters to receive more information</li></ul>
        <ul><li>College advisors recommend using the same email across College Board accounts, social media, and other admissions-related activities (Moody)</li></ul><br>
        
        Another way that students can take control of how their data is used by higher education institutions is by opting-out of the Student Search Service. There are 
        pros and cons to either option, and students should consider each choice thoughtfully. Unfortunately, the majority of students are only given the choice right 
        before the SAT or AP exams when they are stressed and focused on doing well on their test. The best time to configure College Board is evidently not before 
        exams, so students should make this decision far before or after testing days.
